# COP-4530-Project-4
In this project, you shall gain experience with a binary tree and its application in converting postfix expressions into infix expressions.

# Overview
Overall objectives of this project include the following:
    • Understand the binary trees and their applications.
    • Grasp the design and implementation of binary expression tree.
    • Leverage the binary expression tree to convert postfix expressions into infix expressions; and
    • Practice the implementation of recursive algorithms using binary trees.
